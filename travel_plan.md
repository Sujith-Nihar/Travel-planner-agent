Srinagar, the summer capital, is famous for its Dal Lake, where traditional houseboats and *Shikaras* (wooden boats) offer a tranquil experience. The Mughal Gardens, with their terraced lawns, fountains, and vibrant flowerbeds, are a testament to the region's historical grandeur. Beyond Srinagar, destinations like Gulmarg and Pahalgam provide opportunities for adventure activities and exploration of untouched landscapes.
